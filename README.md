‚Ä¢	Business Problem
The global ski tourism industry generates billions in revenue, yet travelers, tour operators, and analysts often lack an intuitive way to compare resorts across countries. 

Key questions such as:

Where is summer skiing available?
What countries have the most well-equipped resorts?
‚Ä¶ are difficult to answer quickly with raw data.

To deliver an interactive visual tool that:
Enables users to explore ski resorts globally.
Supports decisions such as vacation planning, regional marketing, or infrastructure investment.
Uncovers trends in terrain, accessibility, and tourism capacity by region and resort.
